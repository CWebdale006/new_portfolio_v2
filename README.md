# Redoing my HTML portfolio in React 

## Why? 
When I originally designed my portfolio, I was a junior in high school and was new to HTML, CSS, and especially JavaScript. Now, I have graduated from high school and have since expanded my knowledge of both front-end and back-end programming. I thought that while I have a bit of free time before college starts that I would try my hand at writing a better portfolio than the one I wrote over a year ago. 

## Goals: 
- Add necessary resume information 
- Add a place to showcase my coding projects/skills 
- to be continued

### To-Do's (works in progress) 
- The first section: 
    - figure out what to do with the top of my page (reduce the whitespace at the top, add a navbar/logo, or possibly something else entirely)
    [ x ] add an arrow to the "Scroll down for more" part of my page 
        [ x ] make this part just look better in general (hard to read, text is small, etc.)
    - lots and lots of media query work to do with spacing and images and such 
- About me
    - decide to keep or remove the short summary below the "About me" text 
    - replace lorem ipsum with an actual description of me 
    - add a css animation to fade in when users scroll down
