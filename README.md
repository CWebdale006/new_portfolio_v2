# Redoing my HTML portfolio in React 

## Why? 
When I originally designed my portfolio, I was a junior in high school and was new to HTML, CSS, and especially JavaScript. Now, I have graduated from high school and have since expanded my knowledge of both front-end and back-end programming. I thought that while I have a bit of free time before college starts that I would try my hand at writing a better portfolio than the one I wrote over a year ago. 

## Goals: 
- Add necessary resume information 
- Add a place to showcase my coding projects/skills 
- Add a quote/recomendation? 
- to be continued
