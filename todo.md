### To-Do's (works in progress) 
- The first section: 
    - figure out what to do with the top of my page (reduce the whitespace at the top, add a navbar/logo, or possibly something else entirely)
    - add a splash of blue somewhere to balance out the cert. component 
    - ~~add an arrow to the "Scroll down for more" part of my page~~
        - ~~make this part just look better in general (hard to read, text is small, etc.)~~
    - lots and lots of media query work to do with spacing and images and such 
        - ~~make the "scroll down for more" font size bigger on bigger screens~~ 
        - ~~write more body/info text on bigger screens, looks too small lol~~ 
    - ~~make up my mind about what animations to use~~
- About me
    - ~~decide to keep or remove the short summary below the "About me" text~~
    - ~~replace lorem ipsum with an actual description of me~~
    - ~~add a css animation to fade in when users scroll down~~
    - ~~Not to sound like a broken record but this needs media queries too for bigger screens, it doesn't look good (too small)~~ 
- Certifications 
    - ~~This'll be easy enough, just add the MTA and CIW certifications as cards with a short description~~
        - make the images more similar in size 
    - ~~if i wanted to be really cool, i'd make a card where one side would show my MTA, and the user could click on the card to 'flip' it and show the CIW~~
- Project Display 
    - ~~Create an a-frame scene and use vr to display each of my websites on a pedestal of sorts~~ (this'll take forever so i'm doing something else)
    - ~~created a place to display my projects using flexbox so that I can easily add more projects in the future~~
    - ~~Add an animation for flipping between projects~~
        - add a better animation for flipping between projects 
    - Add a loading screen? 
    - default iframe screen 
    - probably the biggest loose end that I have is that my airline website isn't currently deployed, and I can't link it 
- Quotes 
    - As of right now, I only have one quote ii'm interested in displaying from a teacher, but it is still enough to dedicate a section to it i think 
- Footer 
    - ~~I want to have a footer, but i don't really have enough social media to create a dedicated section to it (github/linkedin)~~
    - When hovered, the email logo should display text of my email address
